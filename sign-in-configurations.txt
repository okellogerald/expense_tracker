changed files:
..project-level build.gradle
- kotlin version making it to the 
latest version, which on the time of this app making it was
1.6.10.
- making sure that there is mavenCentral() in both
repositories, in buildscript and allprojects.

..app-level build.gradle
- adding mavenCentral() in the repositories
- added signingConfigs.debug in debug from buildTypes
- in the signingConfigs in the android, you specify the debug
configs. That is after you have created the keystore file by 
keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore "C:\Users\OKERO\.android\debug.keystore" | "C:\Users\OKERO\Documents\tools\openssl\bin\openssl.exe" sha1 -binary |"C:\Users\OKERO\Documents\tools\openssl\bin\openssl.exe" base64
which is then stored in the app directory in the android folder.
- adding multidex support in the defaultConfig and adding in the
implementations. The minSdkVersion has to be 16.

--androidManifest.xml
- I have outlined facebook configurations in the android xml, check them there.
- the values of applicationId and token... are found in the strings.xml that is added
in the values folder that if not yet added, it is supposed to be added in the res directory.
The applicationId is obtained from facebook developers account, and the token from this website:
https://elfsight.com/blog/2017/10/how-to-get-facebook-access-token/ Or directly to
https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer
The facebook app id in the strings.xml is just the string from the combination of fb and the app id.
The app name should be the same as the one in the facebook console.
